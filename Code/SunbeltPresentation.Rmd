# Motivation

--
 
 - Data derived from Waste water is an important measure of the health of a community.
 
--

 - Corona virus Sewer Surveillance is a part of TRACE COVID-19 project. Samples were collected starting mid 2020 and the sampling has been ongoing. 

--

 - Select Sentinel locations from within the wastewater cities to provide early warning system for various pathogens. 

 - Temporal data comparison between waste water data and publicly available cases, death count and vaccine data.

# Social Networks and Community detection within networks. 

--

  - Networks created using Highway data 
  
--

    * Two cities connected by a highway form a connected node pair.
    
    * Waste water cities are isolated and the shortest path between each of these cities is calculated. This forms the network for only wastewater cities.

--

  - Safe graph data movement network
  
--

    * Track movement between cities to create edges.
    
    * If the movement to and from a city reach a particular threshold it is considered an edge. 
  
--

  - Community Detection Algorithm.
  
--

    * Find set of nodes within a network that are closely related to each other based on a certain metric.
  
--

  - Goal for waste water surveillance is to find sentinel node within each community.

# Future Work

- Temporal data

- Missingness of node data

- Add weighted nodes by using Safe Graph data. Currently using Highway data as proxy.
