# <font size="7">Motivation</font>
.pull-left[
- CDC launched National wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in Sept 2020 in order to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Coronavirus Sewer Surveillance began as a part of TRACE COVID-19 project but it has evolved into a standalone project funded by Oregon Health Authority(OHA).

- COVID spreads through airborne transmission

# <font size="7"> Research directions</font>

  - Select Sentinel locations from within the wastewater cities to provide early warning system for various pathogens. 
 
  - Generate a sphere of influence for the important cities.

  - Temporal data comparison between wastewater data and publicly available cases, death count and vaccine data.

# <font size="7">Plot of highway data</font>

There are 242 cities in Oregon, 44 of which participated in the wastewater surveillance program at least once over the last three years.

# <font size="7">Social networks and community detection</font> 

--

  - Networks created using Highway data 
  
--

    * Two cities connected by a highway form a connected node pair.
    
    * The highway connection indicating movement between cities can relate to disease transmisssion.
    
    * Shortest path algorithm is used to find distance between each of the wastewater cities.

--

  - Community Detection Algorithm.
  
--

    * Find set of nodes within a network that are closely related to each other based on a certain metric.
    
    * Node covariates can be used in addition to structural network data. 
    
    * We use wastewater measurements taken at wastewater treatment plants averaged over the delta wave. 
    
    * Adding wastewater measurements can provide us with communities detected along different possible divisions.

# <font size="7">Edge betweenness community detection</font>


- Edge betweeneness of an edge is defined as the number of shortest paths between any two vertices that run through the edge. 

- Edges connecting communities have higher betweenness. 

- Algorithm for identifying communities based on edge betweenness measure:
  
  1) Calculate betweenness for all edges in network
  
  2) Remove edges with highest betweenness
  
  3) Recalculate betweenness for edges affected by removal
  
  4) Repeat from step 2 till no edges remain. 
  
- The above algorithm results in a dendogram with each node as a leaf.

# <font size="7">Spectral community detection without covariates</font>


- Given adjacency matrix $A$, number of clusters K, we can calculate $L = D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2} \in R^{NxN}$ where D is the diagonal matrix of the degree matrix.

- Matrix $X_{nXk} = [X_1 ... X_k]$ can be find by combining eigen vectors corresponding to K largest eigen values of $L_T$. 

- Matrix $X^*$ is formed by normalizing $X$ by row. 

- Treating each row of $X^*$ as a point run K-means clustering algorithm.

#  <font size="7">Spectral community detection with covariates</font>

- The CASC algorithm uses eigen vectors derived from the Matrix $Y = (A+D)X$  Where X is the covariate matrix. 

- The largest $K$ eigen vectors are used to perform K-means clustering.

## <font size="7">Comparison using Adjusted Rand Index</font>

Adjusted Rand Index(ARI) is a common measure used to compare outcomes from community detection algorithms and ground truth.

Here in place for ground truth we are using ARI to compare similarities between two algorithms. 

Comparison between Edge betweenness and Spectral clustering algorithm: 0.54

Comparison between Edge betweenness and Spectral clustering algorithm with Covariates: 0.045

Comparison between Spectral clustering algorithm and Spectral clustering algorithm: 0.016

# <font size="7">Future Work</font>

- Temporal data
  * Some Community Detection Algorithms take into account the temporal nature of edges at different time points.
  * The wastewater data is temporal in nature. One of the direction of our research is including temporal nature of covariates.
--

- Missingness of node data
  * Not all locations provided water samples every week. Hence, assessing communities using CASC is limited by weeks that have information for all or most of the nodes. It is likely the data is not missing at random making the problem a good candidate for further research in data imputation. 
--

- Add weighted edges by using Safe Graph data. Currently using Highway data as proxy.
--

- Add other demographic data, publicly available case, death count and political affiliations as covariates.
--

- Reduce the number of location that we need to monitor to get usable information regarding pathogen spread within the state.
