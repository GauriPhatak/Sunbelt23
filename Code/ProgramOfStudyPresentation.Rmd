# <font size="7">Motivation</font>


  - Community detection is used to find clusters within a network using the edge connection structure of the network.

  - Covariate assisted community detection helps leverage node or edge specific information to form clusters by augmenting network structure information. 

  - Networks with missing data:
  
    - Missing edges
  
    - Missing node or edge covariate values
  
  - The goal is to develop methodology that performs covariate assisted community detection on networks with missing data.

---

# <font size="7">Research Direction</font>

  - Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) specify the probability of observing the entire network as a function of structural network features and node or edge covariates.
  
  - Using appropriate network statistics in this model with the addition of covariate data is a useful tool to discover community structure within a realisation of a network.
  
  - The objective is to design a method that performs iterative updates for imputation of missing data and community detection for the nodes within the network.

# <font size="7">Research in Support of Developed Method</font>

  - Create a framework to generate synthetic networks with covariates with a known community structure.
  
  - Use real life networks such as mobility networks (using Safegraph data) in conjunction with COVID waste water data to perform community detection with the goal of finding sentinel cities in the state of Oregon. An extension of the method we are developing would be to use it in dynamic networks such as the ones created using wastewater data.

# <font size="7">Potential Covariates under Consideration</font>

- COVID waste water data is temporal in nature with missing values at some time points. Adding COVID waste water measurements can provide us with communities detected along divisions such as rural/urban, population or another latent variable.

- Add weighted edges by using Safegraph mobility data.

- Add other demographic data, publicly available case and death count data and political affiliations as covariates.

There are 242 cities in Oregon, 44 of which participated in the COVID waste water surveillance program at least once over the last three years.
